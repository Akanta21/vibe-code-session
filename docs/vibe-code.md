# Vibe Coding Format

## Structure

### 1. **Core Purpose** (Required)
What you're building in one clear sentence.
```
Example: "A task tracker that feels like a calm morning ritual"
```

### 2. **Visual Vibe** (Highly Recommended)
Describe the aesthetic and emotional feel using vivid, specific language.
```
Example:
- "Soft, muted pastels like early dawn"
- "Glassmorphic cards that float gently"
- "Micro-interactions that feel like butter"
- "Dark mode with subtle neon accents, cyberpunk but tasteful"
```

### 3. **Core Features** (Required)
List 3-7 key functional requirements. Be specific but not overly technical.
```
Example:
- Add/delete tasks with smooth animations
- Drag to reorder with haptic-feeling feedback
- Progress visualization that's satisfying to watch
- Persistent storage between sessions
```

### 4. **Interaction Style** (Recommended)
How should it feel to use?
```
Example:
- "Snappy and responsive, animations under 300ms"
- "Gentle hover effects that invite interaction"
- "Satisfying click states with subtle sound-like visual feedback"
```

### 5. **Technical Constraints** (Optional but helpful)
Any specific requirements or limitations.
```
Example:
- "Must work on mobile"
- "Use React with Tailwind"
- "No external API calls"
```

### 6. **Reference Vibes** (Optional but powerful)
Compare to existing designs, products, or aesthetic styles.
```
Example:
- "Linear's command menu but softer"
- "Notion's drag handles but more playful"
- "Apple's iOS weather app gradient style"
```

## Complete Example

**Core Purpose:** A pomodoro timer that makes focus feel rewarding

**Visual Vibe:**
- Deep space theme with subtle nebula gradients
- Timer display uses large, elegant serif numbers
- Ambient glow effects that pulse with the timer
- Buttons are minimal, almost invisible until hover
- Color shifts from cool blue (focus) to warm amber (break time)

**Core Features:**
- 25/5 minute work/break cycles
- Visual progress ring that's mesmerizing to watch
- Ambient sound toggle (gentle rain or silence)
- Session counter that celebrates milestones
- Keyboard shortcuts for start/pause/reset

**Interaction Style:**
- Slow, deliberate animations that encourage calm
- Satisfying "completion" moment with gentle chime visual
- Everything responds to keyboard for flow state
- No jarring movements or aggressive notifications

**Technical Constraints:**
- Single page React component
- All state in memory (no backend)
- Must be usable while in another tab

**Reference Vibes:**
- Stripe's landing page gradient sophistication
- Poolsuite.net's nostalgic-futuristic aesthetic
- Bruno Simon's portfolio subtlety

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific with adjectives** - "clean" is vague, "brutalist with generous whitespace" is clear
2. **Describe feelings, not just features** - "makes you want to keep using it" guides design
3. **Use comparisons** - "like X but more Y" is incredibly effective
4. **Mention what to avoid** - "no harsh shadows" or "no rainbow gradients"
5. **Think in moments** - describe the experience: "when you complete a task, you should feel..."

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ "Make it look good" (too vague)
❌ Overly technical CSS specifications (kills the vibe)
❌ Too many features (dilutes the vision)
❌ Conflicting aesthetic directions
❌ "Professional" without context (corporate? artistic? minimal?)

✅ Instead: Paint a picture with specific, evocative language that captures both function and feeling
